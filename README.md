# AndroidGameControl
A library to wrap up common game control classes that can be used in multiple projects.

This is based on the framework outlined in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430246774">Beginning Android Games</a> by Mario Zechner and Robert Green. It has been modified for my own use, for better or for worse -- maybe for worse... ;)

Reuse, modify, etc, etc. I've already borrowed it all and modified some of it, so have at it.
